# IS211_Assignment2

Hi Professor,

I hope that I did the logging correctly. I also had a question related to the def main vs the if `__name__ == "main"` portion of the code. I'm assuming that you want to stop after calling the function main() inside of the if`__name__` portion of the code? Other than that I did rename the function names and variable names to be more pythonistic(I hate that word, but want to make sure I'm following the guidelines)

please let me know if anything I can approve upon.

Tim
